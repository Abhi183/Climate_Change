# Climate_Change
Final Project for Machine Learning Capstone

Climate change is promoting more extreme weather and affecting atmospheric circulation patterns but in uncertain ways. One type of circulation pattern often associated with extreme rainfall is “cut-off lows” (COLs), which are low-pressure cells that are cut off or displaced from the prevailing jet stream winds and thus relatively stagnant. This research project will focus on applying supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and image-processing algorithms to perform the following:

1-      Automated detection of important patterns such as COLs,  cut-off highs (COH), and closed lows CLs).

2-      Analyzing how COLs are affected by climate change.

The data used in the project consist of multiple realizations of existing climate model output of circulation patterns for simulated past (colder) climatic conditions covering multiple decades of the 19th century compared with projected future (warmer) climatic conditions covering multiple decades of the late 21st century.
